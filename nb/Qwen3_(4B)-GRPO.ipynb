I need to solve this problem where there are three prime numbers p, q, and r. The equations given are pq + qr + rp = 191 and p + q = r - 1. The goal is to find p + q + r. Hmm, primes, so they must be 2 or odd primes. Let me start by analyzing the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the equation p + q = r - 1. If I can express r in terms of p and q, maybe I can substitute that into the first equation. Let's try that. So, from the second equation, r = p + q + 1. That seems straightforward. Now, substituting this into the first equation, we get pq + qr + rp = 191. Let's replace r with (p + q + 1).\\n\\nSo, substituting, the first equation becomes:\\n\\npq + q(p + q + 1) + p(p + q + 1) = 191.\\n\\nLet me expand each term:\\n\\nFirst term: pq.\\n\\nSecond term: q*(p + q + 1) = pq + q\\u00b2 + q.\\n\\nThird term: p*(p + q + 1) = p\\u00b2 + pq + p.\\n\\nNow, adding all these together:\\n\\npq + (pq + q\\u00b2 + q) + (p\\u00b2 + pq + p) = 191.\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\npq + pq + pq = 3pq.\\n\\nq\\u00b2 + p\\u00b2.\\n\\nq + p.\\n\\nSo altogether, the equation becomes:\\n\\np\\u00b2 + q\\u00b2 + 3pq + p + q = 191.\\n\\nHmm. Let me note that.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see. Let's try to group terms. Wait, another approach: since r = p + q + 1, then p + q + r = (p + q) + (p + q + 1) = 2(p + q) + 1. So if I can find p + q, then multiplying by 2 and adding 1 gives me the answer. That's useful. So perhaps instead of dealing with the first equation directly, I can express it in terms of p + q.\\n\\nBut maybe let's work with the equation we derived: p\\u00b2 + q\\u00b2 + 3pq + p + q = 191.\\n\\nWait, another thought: p\\u00b2 + q\\u00b2 + 3pq. Let's recall that (p + q)^2 = p\\u00b2 + 2pq + q\\u00b2, so p\\u00b2 + q\\u00b2 + 3pq = (p + q)^2 + pq.\\n\\nTherefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(p + q)^2 + pq + p + q = 191.\\n\\nLet me set S = p + q, and P = pq. Then the equation becomes:\\n\\nS\\u00b2 + P + S = 191.\\n\\nBut from the second equation, we know that r = S + 1, so since we need to find S + r = S + (S + 1) = 2S + 1. So our target is 2S + 1. So if we can find S, we can find the answer.\\n\\nNow, the equation is S\\u00b2 + P + S = 191. But S and P are related as S = p + q, P = pq. For two primes p and q, their sum and product. Since p and q are primes, maybe we can list possible primes that add up to S and multiply to P. However, since S and P are variables here, maybe we can express P in terms of S from the equation.\\n\\nFrom S\\u00b2 + P + S = 191, so P = 191 - S\\u00b2 - S.\\n\\nTherefore, P = -S\\u00b2 - S + 191. But P = pq must be positive, so -S\\u00b2 - S + 191 > 0. Therefore, S\\u00b2 + S < 191. Let's see the possible values of S. Since S is the sum of two primes, which are at least 2 each, so S is at least 2 + 2 = 4. Also, since S\\u00b2 + S < 191, let's solve S\\u00b2 + S - 191 < 0. Let's find the roots of S\\u00b2 + S - 191 = 0.\\n\\nUsing quadratic formula: S = [-1 \\u00b1 sqrt(1 + 4*191)] / 2 = [-1 \\u00b1 sqrt(765)] / 2. sqrt(765) is approx 27.66, so S \\u2248 (-1 + 27.66)/2 \\u2248 13.33. So the positive root is approximately 13.33, so S must be less than 13.33. Therefore, S can be integers from 4 up to 13.\\n\\nSo possible S values: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\\n\\nBut since p and q are primes, their sum S must be even or odd. Since except for 2, all primes are odd. So if both p and q are odd primes, their sum is even. If one is 2 and the other is odd, then their sum is odd. So S can be even or odd. So possible values of S (from 4 to 13) can be checked.\\n\\nBut maybe instead of all possible S, let's check possible S values from 4 to 13 and see if for each S, P = 191 - S\\u00b2 - S, and check if P can be expressed as the product of two primes that add up to S.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe first check which S gives P as a product of two primes.\\n\\nLet's start with S=4. Then P = 191 - 16 -4 = 171. Then check if 171 can be written as product of two primes that add up to 4. But 4 is the sum. The primes could be 2 and 2 (since 2+2=4). Then 2*2=4, but P here is 171. 4 \\u2260 171, so S=4 is invalid.\\n\\nNext S=5: P=191 -25 -5=161. 161 factors into 7*23. Check if 7 + 23 = 30, which is not 5. So that's not possible. Alternatively, are there primes adding to 5? 2 and 3, since 2+3=5. Then P=2*3=6. But 6 \\u2260 161. So S=5 invalid.\\n\\nS=6: P=191 -36 -6=149. 149 is a prime number, so can't be expressed as product of two primes. So invalid.\\n\\nS=7: P=191 -49 -7=135. 135 factors into 5*27 (but 27 not prime), 3*45, 9*15, none primes. So no. So invalid.\\n\\nS=8: P=191 -64 -8=119. 119 factors into 7*17. Check if 7+17=24\\u22608. Primes adding to 8 are 3+5=8 or 5+3. Then P=15. But 15\\u2260119. So invalid.\\n\\nS=9: P=191 -81 -9=101. 101 is prime, so no.\\n\\nS=10: P=191 -100 -10=81. 81=9*9, but 9 not prime. So no.\\n\\nS=11: P=191 -121 -11=59. 59 is prime. So no.\\n\\nS=12: P=191 -144 -12=35. 35=5*7. Check if 5 +7=12? Yes! 5 +7=12. So here, S=12, which is p + q=12, and pq=35. 5 and 7 are primes. So this works.\\n\\nSo then p=5 and q=7, or p=7 and q=5. Then r = S + 1 =12 +1=13. Check if r is prime: 13 is prime. So yes. So then p, q, r are 5,7,13 or 7,5,13. Then p + q + r =5 +7 +13=25. So 25 would be the answer.\\n\\nWait, let me check S=13 as well just to be thorough. S=13: P=191 -169 -13=9. 9=3*3. Check if 3 +3=6\\u226013. So no. So no.\\n\\nTherefore, only S=12 gives valid primes. So the answer is 25.\\n\\nLet me verify the original equations. pq + qr + rp. Let p=5, q=7, r=13. Then 5*7 +7*13 +13*5 =35 +91 +65=35+91=126+65=191. Which matches. And p + q =5 +7=12. r -1=13 -1=12. So that also matches. So it's correct.

I need to solve this problem where x and y are positive integers satisfying 2(x + y) = gcd(x, y) + lcm(x, y). And I have to find the ratio of the lcm to the gcd of x and y. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that for any two positive integers, the product of the lcm and gcd of those numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, lcm(x, y) * gcd(x, y) = x * y. That might come in handy here. Let me note that down: lcm(x,y)*gcd(x,y) = x*y.\\n\\nGiven the equation 2(x + y) = gcd(x, y) + lcm(x, y), maybe I can express everything in terms of gcd and the ratio of x and y. Since gcd and lcm are involved, it might be helpful to let d = gcd(x, y), and then express x and y as x = d*a and y = d*b, where a and b are coprime integers (their gcd is 1). That's a standard approach for problems involving gcd and lcm.\\n\\nSo let me set d = gcd(x, y). Then x = d*a, y = d*b, with gcd(a, b) = 1. Then, the lcm(x, y) would be d*a*b, because lcm(x, y) = x*y / gcd(x, y) = (d*a*d*b)/d = d*a*b. Right, so lcm(x,y) = d*a*b.\\n\\nSubstituting these into the original equation: 2(x + y) = gcd(x, y) + lcm(x, y).\\n\\nSubstituting x = d*a, y = d*b, gcd = d, lcm = d*a*b. Then:\\n\\n2(d*a + d*b) = d + d*a*b.\\n\\nFactor out d from the left side: 2d(a + b) = d(1 + a*b).\\n\\nSince d is a positive integer, we can divide both sides by d, yielding:\\n\\n2(a + b) = 1 + a*b.\\n\\nSo now the equation simplifies to 2(a + b) = a*b + 1, where a and b are coprime positive integers. Hmm, okay. Now we have a simpler equation to solve: a*b - 2a - 2b + 1 = 0. Let me rearrange that:\\n\\na*b - 2a - 2b + 1 = 0.\\n\\nHmm, maybe factor this equation? Let me see. Adding 4 to both sides might help in factoring. Let's try:\\n\\na*b - 2a - 2b + 1 + 4 - 4 = 0\\n\\nSo, a*b - 2a - 2b + 4 = 3.\\n\\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps rearrange the terms:\\n\\na*b - 2a - 2b = -1.\\n\\nThen, add 4 to both sides:\\n\\na*b - 2a - 2b + 4 = 3.\\n\\nNow, left side can be factored as (a - 2)(b - 2) = 3. Because expanding (a - 2)(b - 2) gives a*b - 2a - 2b + 4. Yes, that's right. So:\\n\\n(a - 2)(b - 2) = 3.\\n\\nSince a and b are positive integers and coprime, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that their product is 3 when each is reduced by 2. Also, since a and b are coprime, (a - 2) and (b - 2) must be divisors of 3, which is prime. The positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3.\\n\\nSo possible pairs (since a and b are positive integers, a - 2 and b - 2 must be at least such that a and b are positive. Let's see:\\n\\nCase 1: (a - 2) = 1 and (b - 2) = 3. Then, a = 3, b = 5. Check if gcd(a, b) = 1. gcd(3, 5) = 1, which is good.\\n\\nCase 2: (a - 2) = 3 and (b - 2) = 1. Then, a = 5, b = 3. Similarly, gcd(5, 3) = 1. So this is also valid.\\n\\nBut also, since 3 is prime, the only positive divisors are 1 and 3. But since we're considering positive integers, we could also consider if one of them is negative? But since a and b are positive, a - 2 and b - 2 must be positive or zero? Wait, but 3 is positive, so the factors must both be positive. Because if one of (a - 2) or (b - 2) were negative, their product would be negative, but 3 is positive. So both (a - 2) and (b - 2) must be positive. Thus, only the two cases above.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe (a - 2) and (b - 2) could be 3 and 1 in some order, which gives the two cases. So the possible (a, b) are (3, 5) and (5, 3). Since a and b are interchangeable (since x and y are symmetric in the problem), these two cases would yield the same results.\\n\\nSo now, let's see. For (a, b) = (3, 5), then x = d*3, y = d*5. Similarly, for (a, b) = (5, 3), x = d*5, y = d*3. But since the problem is symmetric in x and y, both cases are equivalent.\\n\\nNow, since we need to find the ratio lcm(x, y)/gcd(x, y), let's compute that.\\n\\nRecall that lcm(x, y)/gcd(x, y) = (d*a*b)/d = a*b. So it's simply a*b. Since in both cases, a and b are 3 and 5, the product is 15. Therefore, the ratio is 15.\\n\\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\\n\\nIf the ratio is a*b, then yes. Because lcm(x, y) is d*a*b and gcd(x, y) is d, so their ratio is (d*a*b)/d = a*b. Since a and b are 3 and 5, 3*5=15. Therefore, the answer is 15. So the answer is 15.\\n\\nBut let me verify with an example. Let's take d=1. Then x=3, y=5. Then gcd(3,5)=1, lcm=15. Then 2(x + y) = 2*(8) = 16. The right side is 1 + 15=16. So that works. If d=1, then 2(3+5)=16=1 +15.\\n\\nWhat if d=2? Then x=6, y=10. gcd(6,10)=2, lcm=30. Then 2(6 + 10)=2*16=32. The right side is 2 +30=32. So that also works. Then the ratio lcm/gcd is 30/2=15. So regardless of d, the ratio is always 15. Wait, because if x = d*a, y = d*b, then lcm(x,y)/gcd(x,y) = (d*a*b)/d = a*b, which is 15 as in the first case. So regardless of d, the ratio is always 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.\\n\\nSo even if d is some other positive integer, the ratio remains a*b =15. Therefore, the required ratio is 15.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 15. So \\\\boxed{15}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{15}\\n</think>Given \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are positive integers such that \\\\( 2(x + y) = \\\\gcd(x, y) + \\\\text{lcm}(x, y) \\\\), we need to find \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\text{lcm}(x, y)}{\\\\gcd(x, y)} \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, let \\\\( d = \\\\gcd(x, y) \\\\).

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. \\n\\nFirst, the product is 1 \\u00d7 3 \\u00d7 5 \\u00d7 ... \\u00d7 2005. That's a lot of numbers! Since we're dealing with division by 1000, maybe modular arithmetic can help here. The remainder when divided by 1000 is equivalent to the product modulo 1000. But calculating such a huge product directly seems impossible. There has to be a smarter way.\\n\\nI remember that when dealing with factorials and remainders, factors of 2 and 5 can create trailing zeros. However, here we're only multiplying odd numbers, so there are no factors of 2. But there might still be factors of 5. Wait, 1000 is 8\\u00d7125, which is 2^3 \\u00d7 5^3. Since the product is all odd numbers, it won't have factors of 2, but it can have factors of 5. Therefore, the product will be divisible by 5^3, but since there are no 2s, the product modulo 1000 might not be zero. Hmm, maybe I need to compute the product modulo 1000, but adjusting for the factors of 5?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe split the problem into modulo 8 and modulo 125, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to combine the results. Since 1000 = 8 \\u00d7 125, and 8 and 125 are coprime, CRT says that if I can find the remainder modulo 8 and modulo 125, then I can combine them to find the remainder modulo 1000. That might be a good approach.\\n\\nLet me start with modulo 8. The product is 1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d77\\u00d79\\u00d7...\\u00d72005. But modulo 8, odd numbers repeat every 8 numbers. Let's see, the residues modulo 8 of odd numbers are 1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7,... So the pattern repeats every 4 terms. Wait, no. Wait, the numbers go 1,3,5,7,9\\u22611,11\\u22613,13\\u22615,15\\u22617, etc. So every 8 numbers, the cycle of residues 1,3,5,7 repeats twice. Wait, actually, modulo 8, the odd residues cycle every 4 numbers. Let's confirm:\\n\\n1 mod 8 =1\\n\\n3 mod8=3\\n\\n5 mod8=5\\n\\n7 mod8=7\\n\\n9 mod8=1\\n\\n11 mod8=3\\n\\n13 mod8=5\\n\\n15 mod8=7\\n\\nYes, every 4 terms, the cycle repeats. So how many terms are in the product 1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d7...\\u00d72005? Let's find the number of terms first. The nth odd number is 2n-1. So 2n-1=2005 => n=(2005+1)/2=2006/2=1003. So there are 1003 terms.\\n\\nSo 1003 terms, each group of 4 terms (mod8) is 1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d77=105. Then 105 mod8= 105 - 13\\u00d78=105-104=1. So each group of 4 terms multiplies to 1 mod8. Then how many full groups of 4 are there in 1003 terms? Let's divide 1003 by 4. 1003 \\u00f74=250.75. So 250 full groups, each contributing 1 mod8, and then a remainder of 3 terms. \\n\\nSo the total product modulo8 is (1^250) \\u00d7 (last three terms). The last three terms would be the terms after the 250th group. The 250th group ends at term 250\\u00d74=1000. So the 1001st term is 2\\u00d71001 -1=2001. Wait, no: the first term is 1=2\\u00d71-1, second term 3=2\\u00d72-1, so term k is 2k-1. Therefore, term 1001 is 2\\u00d71001 -1=2002-1=2001. Then the 1002nd term is 2003, 1003rd term is 2005. So the last three terms are 2001, 2003, 2005. Let's compute each mod8:\\n\\n2001 \\u00f78: 8\\u00d7250=2000, so 2001 mod8=1\\n\\n2003 mod8=3\\n\\n2005 mod8=5\\n\\nSo the last three terms modulo8 are 1\\u00d73\\u00d75=15 mod8=7.\\n\\nTherefore, total product mod8 is (1^250) \\u00d77=1\\u00d77=7 mod8.\\n\\nSo the remainder modulo8 is7.\\n\\nNow, we need to compute the product modulo125. This seems more complicated. Let's think.\\n\\nThe product is the product of all odd numbers from1 to2005. Wait, 2005=5\\u00d7401. So we can write the product as (1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d77\\u00d7...\\u00d72005). Let's note that there are a lot of factors of 5 in this product, which would make the product divisible by 5 multiple times. However, modulo125 is 5^3, so if the product has at least three factors of 5, then modulo125 would be 0. Wait, but maybe even if it's divisible by 5^3, but we need to compute the actual remainder. Wait, but perhaps the product is divisible by 5^3, but when divided by 5^3, the remaining product modulo8 or something else. Wait, maybe not. Let me check how many factors of5 are in the product.\\n\\nThe number of factors of5 in the product:\\n\\nEach multiple of5 contributes at least one factor of5. Since we're dealing with odd numbers, the multiples of5 that are odd. So numbers divisible by5 but not by2. So numbers like5,15,25,...,2005. Let's count how many multiples of5 are in the product. The first term is5, which is5\\u00d71, then15=5\\u00d73,..., up to2005=5\\u00d7401. So the multiples of5 are5\\u00d7(1,3,5,...,401). Wait, 5\\u00d7k, where k is odd from1 to401. Because 5\\u00d7401=2005. So how many terms are there?\\n\\nThe number of terms k from1 to401 where k is odd. Since401 is odd, the number is (401 +1)/2=201. So there are201 multiples of5 in the product. Each contributes at least one factor of5. Additionally, multiples of25 contribute an extra factor of5. Similarly, multiples of125, 625, etc., contribute more factors.\\n\\nSo let's compute the total number of factors of5 in the product.\\n\\nNumber of multiples of5:201 (as above)\\n\\nNumber of multiples of25: These are numbers in the product divisible by25. Since the product includes numbers of the form5\\u00d7(odd numbers). So multiples of25 are numbers divisible by25, which are 25,75,125,...,2000. But 2005 is not divisible by25. Wait, wait, in the original product (all odd numbers up to2005), the multiples of25 must be odd multiples. So 25\\u00d71,25\\u00d73,..., up to the largest odd multiple less than or equal to2005.\\n\\n25\\u00d7k \\u22642005, where k is odd. Let's compute k_max:\\n\\n25k \\u22642005 => k \\u22642005/25=80.2. So the largest integer k is80, but since k has to be odd, the largest odd k is79. So 25\\u00d779=1975. Then 25\\u00d781=2025, which is over. So the multiples of25 in the product are25\\u00d71,25\\u00d73,...,25\\u00d779. Number of terms: (79-1)/2 +1=39 +1=40. Wait, from1 to79 odd numbers: number is (79+1)/2=40. So there are40 multiples of25.\\n\\nSimilarly, multiples of125:125\\u00d71,125\\u00d73,..., up to125\\u00d7k\\u22642005. 125\\u00d7k \\u22642005 =>k\\u226416.04. So k_max=15 (odd). So 125\\u00d715=1875. So multiples are125\\u00d71,125\\u00d73,...,125\\u00d715. Number of terms: (15-1)/2 +1=7+1=8.\\n\\nMultiples of625:625\\u00d71=625, next is625\\u00d73=1875, next is625\\u00d75=3125>2005. So only two multiples:625 and1875. But1875 is already counted as a multiple of125. So factors of625 contribute an extra factor of5 each. So number of multiples of625 is 2. 625 and1875.\\n\\nMultiples of3125:3125>2005, so none.\\n\\nSo total number of factors of5:\\n\\nFrom multiples of5:201\\n\\nFrom multiples of25:40 (each contributes an extra)\\n\\nFrom multiples of125:8 (each contributes another extra)\\n\\nFrom multiples of625:2 (each contributes another extra)\\n\\nTotal:201 +40 +8 +2=251.\\n\\nSo total factors of5 in the product:251.\\n\\nSimilarly, factors of2: since all numbers are odd, there are none. So the product is divisible by5^251 but not by2. So when dividing by5^3, since 251\\u22653, the product is divisible by5^3. Therefore, the product modulo125 is0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 125 is5^3. If the product has at least three factors of5, then when divided by5^3, the quotient is an integer, but the remainder when divided by125 is0. So if the product is divisible by125, then the remainder is0. But the question is, when we divide the product by1000, which is8\\u00d7125, the remainder is to be found. However, we already considered that modulo8 is7, and modulo125 is... Hmm, but if modulo125 is0, then using CRT, we can say the remainder is a number congruent to7 mod8 and0 mod125. So we need to solve for x\\u22610 mod125 andx\\u22617 mod8.\\n\\nBut wait, let me confirm if modulo125 is indeed0. Let's check: since the product has at least three factors of5, then yes, the product is divisible by5^3, so product \\u22610 mod125. Therefore, modulo125 is0. Therefore, we have:\\n\\nx \\u22617 mod8\\n\\nx \\u22610 mod125\\n\\nWe need to find x such that x \\u22610 mod125 andx \\u22617 mod8. Let\\u2019s solve this system.\\n\\nLet x=125k. Then 125k\\u22617 mod8. Since125 mod8=5, so 5k\\u22617 mod8.\\n\\nWe solve 5k\\u22617 mod8.\\n\\nMultiply both sides by inverse of5 mod8. The inverse of5 mod8 is5, since5\\u00d75=25\\u22611 mod8. So multiply both sides by5:\\n\\nk\\u22617\\u00d75 mod8 =>k\\u226135 mod8 =>35\\u00f78=4*8=32, 35-32=3. So k\\u22613 mod8.\\n\\nTherefore, k=8m +3 for some integer m. Therefore, x=125(8m +3)=1000m +375. Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is375. Therefore, the remainder is375 when divided by1000. So the answer is375.\\n\\nWait, but before accepting that, let me verify my steps again because this is tricky.\\n\\nFirst, confirming that the product is divisible by5^3: yes, since there are 251 factors of5, so 5^251 divides the product. Therefore, the product is divisible by5^3, so product\\u22610 mod125. That's correct.\\n\\nThen, solving x\\u22617 mod8 and x\\u22610 mod125. So x=125k. Then 125k\\u22615k mod8. So 5k\\u22617 mod8. Multiply both sides by inverse of5 mod8, which is5, since5\\u00d75=25\\u22611 mod8. So k\\u226135 mod8\\u22613 mod8. Therefore, k=8m +3, so x=125\\u00d73 +1000m=375 +1000m. So the minimal positive solution is375. So remainder is375 when divided by1000. That seems correct.\\n\\nBut wait, to make sure, let me check with an example. Let's take x=375. 375 \\u00f78=46*8=368, remainder7. So 375 mod8=7. 375 mod125=0. So yes, 375 satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the remainder is375. Therefore, the answer is\\\\boxed{375}.\\n\\nWait, but I need to make sure that my calculation for modulo8 and modulo125 are correct. Let me double-check the modulo8 calculation.\\n\\nEarlier, I considered that the product modulo8 is7. Let me recast that.\\n\\nThe product is1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d77\\u00d7\\u2026\\u00d72005. When taking modulo8, each cycle of4 terms (1,3,5,7) multiplies to1\\u00d73\\u00d75\\u00d77=105\\u22611 mod8. Since 105/8=13\\u00d78=104, 105-104=1. Then, since there are1003 terms, how many cycles of4 are there? 1003 divided by4 is250 cycles with a remainder of3 terms. Then the product is (1)^250 \\u00d7 last3 terms.\\n\\nThe last3 terms are2001,2003,2005. 2001 mod8=1 (2001-8\\u00d7250=2001-2000=1), 2003=2001+2\\u21921+2=3 mod8, 2005=2001+4\\u21921+4=5 mod8. So last3 terms are1\\u00d73\\u00d75=15\\u22617 mod8. Therefore, total product\\u22611^250 \\u00d77\\u22617 mod8. Correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the logic holds. Therefore, the remainder is375. So I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{375}\\n</think>To find the remainder when the product \\\\(1 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times 2005\\\\) is divided by 1000, we use modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).\\n\\n### Step 1: Calculate the product modulo 8\\n\\nThe sequence of odd numbers modulo 8 repeats every 4 terms: \\\\(1, 3, 5, 7\\\\). The product of each cycle is:\\n\\\\[\\n1 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 7 = 105 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThere are 1003 terms in the product. Dividing 1003 by 4 gives 250 full cycles and a remainder of 3 terms. The remaining terms are 2001, 2003, and 2005. We calculate these modulo 8:\\n\\\\[\\n2001 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 8, \\\\quad 2003 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 8, \\\\quad 2005 \\\\equiv 5 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\nThe product of these remaining terms is:\\n\\\\[\\n1 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\equiv 7 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the product modulo 8 is:\\n\\\\[\\n1^{250} \\\\times 7 \\\\equiv 7 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate the product modulo 125\\n\\nWe need to determine the number of factors of 5 in the product. The sequence of odd numbers includes multiples of 5, 25, 125, and 625.\\n\\n- Multiples of 5: \\\\(5, 15, 25, \\\\ldots, 2005\\\\)\\n  - These are of the form \\\\(5 \\\\times (2k+1)\\\\) for \\\\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 200\\\\)\\n  - Number of such terms: \\\\(\\\\frac{2005}{5} = 401\\\\), and half of these are odd, so \\\\(201\\\\) multiples of 5.\\n\\n- Multiples of 25: \\\\(25, 75, 125, \\\\ldots, 1975\\\\)\\n  - These are of the form \\\\(25 \\\\times (2k+1)\\\\) for \\\\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 39\\\\)\\n  - Number of such terms: \\\\(\\\\frac{1975}{25} = 79\\\\), and half of these are odd, so \\\\(40\\\\) multiples of 25.\\n\\n- Multiples of 125: \\\\(125, 375, 625, 875, 1125, 1375, 1625, 1875\\\\)\\n  - These are of the form \\\\(125 \\\\times (2k+1)\\\\) for \\\\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 15\\\\)\\n  - Number of such terms: \\\\(\\\\frac{1875}{125} = 15\\\\), and half of these are odd, so \\\\(8\\\\) multiples of 125.\\n\\n- Multiples of 625: \\\\(625, 1875\\\\)\\n  - These are of the form \\\\(625 \\\\times (2k+1)\\\\) for \\\\(k = 0, 1\\\\)\\n  - Number of such terms: \\\\(\\\\frac{1875}{625} = 3\\\\), and half of these are odd, so \\\\(2\\\\) multiples of 625.\\n\\nTotal factors of 5:\\n\\\\[\\n201 + 40 + 8 + 2 = 251\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\(251 \\\\geq 3\\\\), the product is divisible by \\\\(5^3 = 125\\\\). Therefore, the product modulo 125 is:\\n\\\\[\\n0 \\\\mod 125\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Combine results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\\\[\\nx \\\\equiv 7 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nx \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 125\\n\\\\]\\n\\nLet \\\\(x = 125k\\\\). Then:\\n\\\\[\\n125k \\\\equiv 7 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\(125 \\\\equiv 5 \\\\mod 8\\\\), we have:\\n\\\\[\\n5k \\\\equiv 7 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 8 is 5, so:\\n\\\\[\\nk \\\\equiv 7 \\\\times 5 \\\\equiv 35 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 8\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, \\\\(k = 8m + 3\\\\) for some integer \\\\(m\\\\). Therefore:\\n\\\\[\\nx = 125(8m + 3) = 1000m + 375\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe smallest non-negative solution is:\\n\\\\[\\nx = 375\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{375}\\n\\\\]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I need to solve the equation ‚àö(x¬≤ + 165) - ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n‚àö(x¬≤ + 165) - ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\n‚àö(x¬≤ + 165) = 7 + ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(‚àö(x¬≤ + 165))¬≤ = (7 + ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52))¬≤.\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nx¬≤ + 165 = 49 + 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) + (‚àö(x¬≤ - 52))¬≤.\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)¬≤ = a¬≤ + 2ab + b¬≤. So the right side becomes 7¬≤ + 2*7*‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) + (‚àö(x¬≤ - 52))¬≤, which is 49 + 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) + (x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nx¬≤ + 165 = 49 + 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) + x¬≤ - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The x¬≤ terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract x¬≤ from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\n12 = ‚àö(x¬≤ - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12¬≤ = x¬≤ - 52.\\n\\n144 = x¬≤ - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = x¬≤.\\n\\n196 = x¬≤.\\n\\nSo x = ‚àö196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\n‚àö(14¬≤ + 165) - ‚àö(14¬≤ - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14¬≤ is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: ‚àö(196 + 165) = ‚àö361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: ‚àö(196 - 52) = ‚àö144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\nTo solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9. Add 52 to both sides to solve for \\\\(x^2\\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   196 = x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n10. Take the positive square root (since \\\\(x\\\\) is positive):\\n    \\\\[\\n    x = \\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n11.

The goal is to find how many positive integers are divisors of at least two different numbers in this set.\n",

Since each number is a power, their prime factorizations might have common divisors. For example, 4 and 8 are both powers of 2, so all powers of 2 are their common divisors. Similarly, 9 and 27 share powers of 3. But some numbers might not share common divisors, like 1 and 4. Wait, but 1 divides every integer, so 1 is a common divisor for every pair. So the number 1 is counted. Then, we need to look for other numbers.\n",

Alternatively, maybe find the GCD of the entire set, but since some numbers are coprime (like 10^10 and 9^9), the GCD of the entire set is 1. But then, the divisors would just be 1. But wait, the problem asks for divisors that divide at least two numbers, so if the GCD is 1, then only 1 is the common divisor. But that can't be right because some pairs have common divisors greater than 1.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think differently. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of integers that are common divisors of at least two different elements in the set. So, for each pair of elements, find their GCD, and then count the total distinct GCD values. But since some pairs might have different GCDs, and some common divisors might be included multiple times, we need to count them once.\n",

But since each number is a power of itself, their GCD depends on the common bases. From the list, the numbers are 1, 4, 27, 256, 3125, 46656, 823543, 16777216, 387420489, 10000000000. \n",

So some pairs have GCD 1. Then, pairs with common prime factors will have GCDs equal to that prime. For example, 4 and 16 (if it were there) would have gcd 4. But in our set, the primes involved are 2,3,5,7,11 (since 10^10 is 2^10*5^10). So the possible common divisors are the primes themselves and their powers up to the minimum in each pair.\n",

Similarly, 3 divides 27,81,... up to 3^9. But wait, 27 is 3^3. So the powers of 3 up to 3^3, since 3^4 = 81 is not present in the set.

Let me think about the maximum possible value for A+B. If A and B are the two largest digits available, then that would be 9 and 8, which sum to 17. But then the denominator would have to be a divisor of 17. The only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17 since 17 is a prime number. But if the denominator is 17, then C+D would have to be 1, which means C and D are 0 and 9 or 1 and 8, but since we can't repeat digits with A and B, which might include 9 and 8, this seems tricky.\n",

              "\"Okay, so I need to find the square root of 101. Hmm, I remember that square roots are about finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. But 101 isn't a perfect square, right? Let me think. The squares around 101 would be 100 (which is 10 squared) and 121 (which is 11 squared). So the square root of 101 is somewhere between 10 and 11. \\n\\nBut the problem is asking for the square root, which might be an irrational number. So maybe it's a decimal? Let me try to estimate. I need to find the number that's closer to 10.5. Let me test 10.05. If I square that, it's (10 + 0.05)*(10 + 0.05) = 100 + 0.05*10 + 0.05*10 + 0.05*0.05 = 100 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.0025 = 101.0025. That's very close to 101. So maybe the square root is 10.05 plus or minus a little bit. \\n\\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Since 10.05 squared is 101.0025, which is slightly above 101, the actual square root should be slightly less than 10.05. Let me try 10.04. Squaring 10.04: (10 + 0.04)*(10 + 0.04) = 100 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.0016 = 100.8016. That's closer, but still above 101. So maybe 10.045? Let me compute that. \\n\\n10.045 squared would be (10 + 0.045)^2 = 100 + 0.045*10 + 0.045*10 + 0.045*0.045 = 100 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.002025 = 100.892025. Still above. Hmm, maybe 10.03? \\n\\n10.03 squared is (10 + 0.03)* (10 + 0.03) = 100 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.0009 = 100.6009. That's below 101. So between 10.03 and 10.045. Let me try 10.042. \\n\\n10.042 squared is about 100 + 0.42 + 0.42 + 0.001764 = 100.841764. Still above 101. Let's try 10.04. Wait, 10.04 squared is 100.8016, which is below 101. So the square root is between 10.04 and 10.042. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the square root more precisely. Let's assume that the square root is 10.05 - x. Then (10.05 - x)^2 = 101. Expanding, that's 101.0025 - 20.1x + x^2 = 101. So 20.1x - x^2 = 0.0025. Since x is small, x^2 is negligible. So 20.1x ‚âà 0.0025. Then x ‚âà 0.0025 / 20.1 ‚âà 0.000124. So 10.05 - 0.000124 ‚âà 10.049876. Let me check this. \\n\\n10.049876 squared: approximately 100.9999... which is very close to 101. This makes sense. So the square root of 101 is approximately 10.0498756211. \\n\\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient method. Like using the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. Let me recall. The formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). For square root of a, the function is f(x) = x^2 - a, so f'(x) = 2x. So starting with an initial guess, say x0 = 10. Then x1 = 10 - (100 - 101)/(2*10) = 10 - (-1)/20 = 10 + 0.05 = 10.05. Then x2 = 10.05 - (10.05^2 - 101)/(2*10.05). \\n\\nCompute 10.05^2: 100.0025. So (10.05^2 - 101) = 10.05^2 - 101 = -0.9975. Then x2 = 10.05 - (-0.9975)/20.1 ‚âà 10.05 + 0.049627 = 10.099627. Wait, that seems higher than the previous approximation. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\\n\\nOriginal equation x_{n+1} = x_n - (x_n^2 - a)/(2x_n). So for x0 = 10, x1 = 10 - (100 - 101)/(20) = 10 + 0.05 = 10.05. Then for x1=10.05, x2 = 10.05 - (10.05^2 - 101)/(2*10.05). \\n\\n10.05^2 = 101.0025. So numerator is 101.0025 - 101 = 0.0025. Denominator is 2*10.05 = 20.1. So x2 = 10.05 - 0.0025/20.1 ‚âà 10.05 - 0.000124 ‚âà 10.049876. Ok, that matches the earlier approximation. So the square root of 101 is approximately 10.0498756211. \\n\\nBut to present it more neatly, maybe up to a certain decimal place. Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the exact answer is left as ‚àö101, but if we need an approximation, it's 10.049987551. But after checking, it's approximately 10.0498756211. Therefore, the square root of 101 is ‚àö101, which is approximately 10.0498756211.\\nTo find the square root of 101, we can use the fact that it lies between the perfect squares of 10 and 11. Let's start by noting that:\\n\\n\\\\[ 10^2 = 100 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 11^2 = 121 \\\\]\\n\\nThus, \\\\(\\\\sqrt{101}\\\\) is between 10 and 11. To get a more precise estimate, we can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding roots of equations. We start with an initial guess \\\\(x_0 = 10\\\\).\\n\\nThe Newton-Raphson formula for finding the square root of \\\\(a\\\\) is given by:\\n\\n\\\\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\\\frac{x_n^2 - a}{2x_n} \\\\]\\n\\nLet's perform the iterations:\\n\\n1. **First iteration**:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x_0 = 10\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   x_1 = 10 - \\\\frac{10^2 - 101}{2 \\\\cdot 10} = 10 - \\\\frac{100 - 101}{20} = 10 + \\\\frac{1}{20} =\""
